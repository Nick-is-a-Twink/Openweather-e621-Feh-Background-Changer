To set up a cron job to make this run every (x) amount of minutes: 

To get Cronie working:
>Download the package Cronie ("Sudo pacman -S cronie" on Arch)
>Enable the cronie daemon so it runs on boot, for Cronie its cronie.service (sudo systemctl enable cronie.service)

To get the cronjob set up for this:
>Edit the cronjob for your current user with "crontab -e"
>In the file write:

  */5 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 python (path to your python file)
  @reboot DISPLAY=:0 python (path to your python file) 
 
>The */5 means every 5 minutes, change the number to change the time between changing backgrounds
>Restart the service with "sudo systemctl restart cronie.service" and the script should be working  

Note: If this doesn't work, try running the python file on its own with "python path/to/the/file"
      If it runs with that, then write the command "who" and see what it says in the () and replace that in DISPLAY=:0
