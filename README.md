# Openweather-e621-Feh-Background-Changer
This will change your feh background to an image from e621.net that relates to the weather in your area using OpenweatherAPI

To use, be sure to set the api key and location to your own for Openweather API

> api_key = "(Your Openweather API Key)"

> lat = "(latitude)"

> lon = "(longitude)"

for example:

> api_key = "ui89wydf9ahyf98sd7ya987ygsd980"

> lat = "40.111"

> lon = "-88.888"

I'm using a cron job to make this script go every 30 minutes, but you could do whatever you want with the code.
